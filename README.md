Tooltip Component

A simple tooltip component that displays a tooltip when hovering over a button. The component should accept a prop called position, which can be set to one of the following values: "top", "bottom", "right", or "left". Depending on the chosen position, the tooltip should appear at the specified location relative to the button.

The tooltip appears when hovering over a button and can be positioned at the top, bottom, right, or left of the button, based on the position prop. This component provides an easy and flexible way to add tooltips to user interfaces, enhancing the user experience and providing additional context to interactive elements. The repository includes the source code for the tooltip component, along with example usage and documentation to help developers integrate tooltips seamlessly into their React applications.
